# ESG-Sentiment-Dataset
A synthetic dataset created to explore the relationships between sentiment, ESG scores, and eco-friendliness in product evaluations.
ESG Sentiment Dataset
Overview

This repository contains a synthetic dataset created to facilitate the study of the relationships between sentiment, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores, and the eco-friendliness of products. Due to the absence of an existing dataset that includes sentiments alongside the classification of products as eco-friendly or non-eco-friendly, this dataset was constructed to support analysis in this area.
Dataset Description

The dataset comprises 910 entries, each containing the following attributes:

    Product Name: The name of the product.
    Sentence: A textual description or review associated with the product.
    Sentiment: The sentiment of the text, categorized as either "Positive" or "Negative".
    ESG Score: A numerical value representing the product's overall ESG performance.
    Environmental Score: A numerical value representing the environmental aspect of the ESG metrics.
    Status: A classification indicating whether the product is "Eco-friendly" or "Non Eco-friendly".
